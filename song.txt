So stay safe, or get left with chest on your face
As death waits for your last of breath
I'ma pass the test, yes, I'm a master chef
Want a taste, then pay for it
They claim they're real, but they're seldom straightforward
The pain I feel on my frame gets transmuted to a dangerous flame
I spit fire at the devil while the angels sang
The flow changed, but Jermaine's the same, I'm Plain Jane
