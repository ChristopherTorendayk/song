Please believe these flows teach egos to freeze and then recede, I'm C4
Beneath your Jeep, the second you turn that keyhole
Then heat blows your weak flows right out the water
The father, boy, I work smarter and harder
My style got a restraining order, don't bother
I charter unseen territories in order to push it farther than you niggas had ever thought of
I caught a lotta murder charges, turned artists to martyrs, when I rock, thot turns to goddess
Fiends turn to kings, dreams turn to things tangible
My hands are full with grands I pulled
From stanzas, no, I can't go slow
I'm Sandra Bull, either proceed with speed or don't breathe
There's no creed or color that won't heed
To the warning, the planet'll shake when I'm performing
Tectonic plates from a place where Tecs on their waist
So stay safe, or get left with chest on your face
As death waits for your last of breath
I'ma pass the test, yes, I'm a master chef
Want a taste, then pay for it
They claim they're real, but they're seldom straightforward
The pain I feel on my frame gets transmuted to a dangerous flame
I spit fire at the devil while the angels sang
The flow changed, but Jermaine's the same, I'm Plain Jane
Not a chain on my neck, but shine like baguettes
A shame, not a flex, to rhyme like the rest
My mind's quite depressed if I don't write these
I'm Spike Lee of the audio, back in my barrio
Parties got shot up, so I built up all my cardio
Dodge shells, collect coins like I'm Mario
But this is not a gaming experience, I'm serious, nigga
